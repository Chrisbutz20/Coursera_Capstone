 #Introduction
 
 A growing trend in young people is to move to a new city full of opporunity, fun, and often, like-minded individuals.
 Yet, they show intimidation by flying too far from the roost. As such, they look for areas that are new but not too far (physically) from family and friends.
 This project aims to make this move easier on younger generations in the Midwestern United States.
 The model will analyze major metropolitan areas around the Midwestern United States to identify the similarities and disimilarities between them.
